PURPOSE OF LITERATURE REVIEW                                                       1

                                        Abstract

                  This article presents a detailed examination of the benefits,
          challenges, and purpose of conducting a doctoral-level literature re-
          view. The article analyzes both the cognitive neurolinguistic pro-
          cessing challenges attending the assimilation and synthesis of large
          volumes of new information and the metacognitive knowledge strate-
          gies needed to overcome them. Finally, the article concludes with
          a topic section identifying the purpose of a doctoral-level literature
          review.

                         Benefits of Conducting Literature Reviews


       According to Walter and Stouck (2020), one purpose of a literature review is to aid the
doctoral aspirant in the development of their professional, scholarly, doctoral identity. Walter
and Stouck cites a complementary study by Wisker (2015) which correlates writing literature
reviews with doctoral students’ metacognitive skill sets, especially including the development
of the necessary endurance and aptitude needed to be successful in a doctoral program 2020.
Among the most necessary skills is to attain the ability to conduct what the anthropologist
Turnbull calls deep reading in his book The Forest People (Turnbull, 1987).


                               Challenges of Literature Reviews


       The literature review is a daunting process because the doctoral student encounters
vast, unwieldy quantities of data, often riddled with obscure, arcane, or incomprehensibly poly-
syllabic words and verbiage (Walter & Stouck, 2020). The first task is merely to comprehend
the words the student is reading which is nontrivial from a neurological perspective. Indeed,
the results of an EEG-based empirical study by Kimppa, Shtyrov, Hut, Hedlund, Leminen,
and Leminen (2018) revealed that adult learners experience much longer processing times
when acquiring new vocabulary.
       The Kimppa et al. study also revealed this initial lexical or new word acquisition occurs
in the slow-to-store but fast-to-lose declarative memory center rather than the more automatic
and long-term procedural memory center of the human brain (2018). This is to say that
students must first master the vocabulary of their literature before they may properly review it.
Luckily, pedagogical and andragogical research have afforded doctoral learners some useful
tools to aid in this titantic endeavor. In the next section resolutions to these challenges are
presented. Once the student is equipped with the intellectual tools presented below they may
proceed to conduct their literature reviews.

                               Purpose of Literature Reviews


       Once students master critical textual analysis of several texts, they must deploy a
schema for organizing the synthesizing that vast quantity of information using a tool such as
the thematic matrix which Robinson (2021) refers to as structured tabular thematic analysis or
ST-TU before they are prepared to write a literature review which includes both an annotated
bibliography and, among other sections, a topic statement and problem statement. Once key
themes which recur among all the scholarly research articles included in the ST-TU, a student
must employ one or more metacognitive knowledge strategies (MKS) (MKSs in order to
synthesize their main ideas, and integrate them into an emergent, coalescence which may be
further sublimated into a thesis, topic, or problem statement (Wisker, 2015).
