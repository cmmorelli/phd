# Limitations

- I don't create an intermediate AST yet, so <TeX/>'s conditional expressions are impossible
- deprecated macros, or macros that are not supposed to be used in <latex/>, won't even exist in <latex/>.js.
  Examples include: `eqnarray`, the old <latex/> 2.09 font macros `\it`, `\sl`, etc. Also missing are most of the plain<TeX/> macros.
  See also [`l2tabuen.pdf`](ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/info/l2tabu/english/l2tabuen.pdf).
- incorrect but legal markup in <latex/> won't produce the same result in <latex/>.js - like when using `\raggedleft` in the
  middle of a paragraph; but the <latex/>.js result should be intuitively correct.
- because of the limitations when parsing <TeX/> as a context-free grammar (see [below](#parsing-tex)), native <latex/> packages
  cannot be parsed and loaded. Instead, the macros those packages (and documentclasses) provide have to be implemented in
  JavaScript.
- every macro in <latex/>.js has to return a document (fragment) node, so incomplete snippets of <latex/> are currently unsupported; this
  will be fixed by an intermediate AST.


## ... due to HTML and CSS

There are some limitations that could theoretically be fixed with (a lot) more effort:

- <TeX/> boxes have a height and a depth, the depth being 0 if the box doesn't contain text that needs it. CSS boxes don't know
  about depth, they only have a height. HTML text in a box does have a baseline, but it *always* adds the space under the baseline.
  This causes little visual differences compared to <latex/>.


The following features in <latex/> just cannot be translated to HTML, not even when using JavaScript:

- <TeX/> removes any whitespace from the beginning and end of a line, even consecutive ones that would be printed in the middle
  of a line, like `\ ` or `~` or ^^0020. This is not possible in HTML (yet - maybe it will be with CSS4).
- horizontal glue, like `\hfill` in a paragraph of text, is not possible
- vertical glue makes no sense in HTML, and is impossible to emulate, except in boxes with fixed height
- `\vspace{}` with a negative value in horizontal mode, i.e. in the middle of a paragraph of text, is not possible
  (but this feature is useless anyway)

And the concept of pages does not really apply to HTML, so any macro related to pagebreaks will be ignored. One
could say that splitting a HTML file into multiple files is like a pagebreak, but then, still, it would be much
easier to handle: just choose a break before a new section or paragraph. There is no absolute space limitation
like on a real page.



## <a name="parsing-tex"></a> ... when parsing TeX as a context-free grammar

This is a PEG parser, which means it interprets <latex/> as a context-free language. However, <TeX/> (and therefore <latex/>) is
Turing complete, so <TeX/> can only really be parsed by a complete Turing machine. It is not possible to parse the full
<TeX/> language with a static parser. See
[here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/4201/is-there-a-bnf-grammar-of-the-tex-language) for some interesting
examples.

It is even undecidable whether a <TeX/> program has a parse tree. There has been done some research
on the problem of parsing <TeX/>, see [here](http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~seba/publications/sle10.pdf).

To quote the four problems of <TeX/>:

- Since <TeX/> has dynamic scoping, it is not possible to determine statically
  wheather `a` is an argument to `\app` in `\app a` or just another letter. It depends on the definition of `\app` at
  runtime.

- Macros can be passed as arguments to other macros, further complicating this problem. E.g.:
  ```tex
  \def\app #1 #2 {#1 #2}
  \def\id #1 {#1}
  \app a b
  \app \id c
  ```
  Thus, targets of macro calls can in general not be determined statically.

- <TeX/> has a lexical macro system, which means macro bodies do not have to be syntactically correct pieces
  of <TeX/> code. Also, macros can expand to new macro definitions.

- Tex allows custom macro call syntax. Basically, any syntax could be changed.


I therefore take a slightly different approach:

- First, I don't care about <TeX/>, but only <latex/>, and most <latex/> documents do not use <TeX/> syntax, or `\def` in
  particular. Therefore, this parser assumes standard <latex/> syntax and catcodes.

- Second, for now there is no way of defining macros, only expanding macros is supported. So if a new
  <latex/> macro is needed, reimplement it in JavaScript directly, thus circumventing the problem altogether.


### Expansion and Execution

Additionally, this parser does not implement <TeX/>'s distinction of expansion and
execution. I am not yet sure if I need to implement it at all. Right now, there is only one phase that takes a macro
and returns an HTML fragment.

Skipped spaces and macros that expand to a macro taking a parameter further down in the input provide a good
illustration of why <TeX/> makes this distinction. Consider the commands
```tex
\def\a{\penalty200}
\a 0
```
This is not equivalent to
```tex
\penalty200 0
```
which would place a penalty of 200, and typeset the digit 0. Instead, it expands to
```tex
\penalty2000
```
because the space after `\a` is skipped in the input processor. Later stages of processing then receive the sequence
```tex
\a0
```
However, <latex/> documents themselves usually don't rely on or need this featureâ€”that is, until I'm convinced otherwise.

This also means that you cannot use `\vs^^+ip` to have <latex/>.js interpret it as `\vskip`. Again, this is a feature
that most people will probably never need.
