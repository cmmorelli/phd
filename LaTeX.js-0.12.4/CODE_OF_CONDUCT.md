# Code of Merit

1. The managing members have final say in every decision of the project.

2. Contributions are evaluated solely based on technical merits.

3. All members have the same opportunities to seek any challenge within the project.

4. Authority or position in the project is proportional to the accrued contribution. Seniority must be earned.

5. Do not expect others to do your work or help you with your work forever.

6. Topics outside of the scope of the project will not be tolerated. This is a space for technical excellence.

7. Discuss or debate the idea, not the person. Be respectful, compassionate human beings.

8. There is no room for ambiguity. Ambiguity will be met with questioning, further ambiguity will be met with silence.
   It is the responsibility of the originator to provide the requested context.

9. This Code of Merit governs the technical procedures within the project, not the activities outside of it.

10. Nontechnical conflicts will be discussed in a separate space. Disruption of the project will not be allowed.

11. No objectives beyond the stated mission of this project are relevant to the project. Any intent to deviate the
    project from its original purpose of existence will be ignored.

12. Participation on the project equates to agreement of this Code of Merit.
