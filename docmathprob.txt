Abstract

This paper presents evidence indicating doctoral students’
mathematical, logical, and statistical skills are too underdeveloped
to understand, validate, and replicate findings in scholarly research
or conduct such researches on their own leading to high attrition
rates (Bickel, 2021).
The status quo in doctoral education is in dire need of
enhanced mathematical, logical, and statistical training—remediation
is needed now. According to Cronley, Black, and Killian (2019),
most doctoral students pursuing PhDs in non-STEM related
disciplines fail to complete their dissertations and attrite. While
many factors contribute to doctoral attrition, among the most
commonly identified reasons students fail are their impoverished
mathematical abilities, misuse and misunderstanding of logical
reasoning, and lack of computational and analytical skills needed
to calculate and evaluate statistics (Cronley et al., 2019). Statistical
analysis is one of the core skills required for successful doctoral
research Harrington, Petr, Black, Cunningham-Williams, and
Bentley (2014).

Introduction: The Math Problem
Establishing Status Quo Statistical Analysis Illiteracy among Doctoral Students
Presently, a majority of doctoral students lack the mathematical, logical, and statistical skills
necessary to complete their degrees and immediate intervention and remediation is both timely and necessary
(Cronley et al., 2019; Harrington et al., 2014; & Petr et al., 2015). The importance of statistical, logical,
and mathematical literacy is attested to by a study published by Harrington et al. (2014): Among the
nine main skills deemed utterly compulsory and essential to doctoral success, mathematics and specifically
statistical analysis were identified as two of the most acutely critical. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of
mathematical, logical, and statistical literacy among doctoral students: According to a study by Petr et al.
(2015) cited in an article by Cronley et al. (2019), most doctoral students in non-STEM PhD programs
lack sufficient training in statistical analysis.
As a result, Cronley et al. indicates the majority of non-STEM doctoral candidates are poorly
educated in statistical analysis (2019). Such students may be completely ignorant of the mathematical and
logical significance of the descriptive and inferential statistics which are ubiquitous in modern academic
scholarship. The studies by both Cronley et al. (2019) and Petr et al. (2015) emphasize the absolute
necessity for reform, intervention, and training of existing and future doctoral candidates in statistical,
logical, and mathematical analysis.
The Exigent Necessity of Statistical Knowledge & Skills for Doctoral Learners
The admonitory mandate cited above holds true even if doctoral students are pursuing a qualitative
dissertation or are enrolled in a non-STEM related doctoral program Cronley et al. (2019): The doctoral
candidates’ abilities to analyze the results, assumptions, and criteria of empirical research they reference
will be hobbled; the potential for drawing false conclusions will be accentuated; the ability of statistically-inept
students to evaluate the credibility of their sources will be reduced or eliminated; and doctoral attrition
rates will continue to rise beyond their current rates exceeding fifty percent. It is an urgent, exigent illiteracy
that must be immediately mended or doctoral students lacking these knowledge and skills will have little
hope of ever completing a dissertation that requires even a modicum of empirical data collection and analysis
(Cronley et al., 2019; Bickel, 2021; Harrington et al., 2014; and Petr et al., 2015).

Justification for Remediation of Null Hypothesis Testing Skills
Studies and analyses by Klebel, Reichmann, Polka, McDowell, Penfold, Hindle, and Ross-Hellauer
(2020) and the editors of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (2019) ramify
the centrality and importance of validating and critiquing cited works. According to Bickel (2021), the
null hypothesis test is among the least understood yet most consequential statistical metrics needed to
evaluate the credibility of and critique the empirical techniques and findings of any scholarly academic
study. Successful doctoral candidates must master their [mis]understandings of the null hypothesis, learn
how to perform this test in their own research, and learn how to interpret the results of a null hypothesis
test (i.e. learn how to evaluate the test’s resulting P-Value and make a Boolean decision to either accept
or reject the null hypothesis).
